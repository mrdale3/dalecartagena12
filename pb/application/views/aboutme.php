<br> ME,MYSELF AND I</br>
<br>Hi my name is Dale Christopher Cartagena im 21 years of age.My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me.</br>
